            Product leader with 10+ years building streaming and content platforms for brands like Tubi, Nickelodeon, and the NBA. I specialize in turning messy platform problems into sleek, scalable experiences â€” whether it's CTV, mobile, or the bleeding edge (hi, Vision Pro ðŸ‘‹).

            I lead with clarity, data, and empathy, helping cross-functional teams ship fast, smart, and with purpose. I'm a strategic thinker who loves finding overlooked growth levers, rallying a team around the solution, and then delivering features that actually get used.

            When I'm not building things, I'm probably reading classic sci-fi, nerding out on puzzles, or diving into yet another new AI tool.
